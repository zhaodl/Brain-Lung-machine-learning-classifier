The interaction among multiple organs is a key focus in biological and clinical research. In this study, clinical data and CT scan data of patients with three different severity levels (mild, moderate, and severe) of traumatic brain injury were collected. Three-dimensional models were reconstructed using CT data and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted. Based on the simulation results, a machine learning model was developed, and correlation analysis was used to bidirectionally verify the robust connection between respiratory aerodynamic characteristics and brain injury.
